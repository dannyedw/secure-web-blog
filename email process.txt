signup:
    Enter username, password, first and last name, email
        User added to database but marked as currently signing up, so username and email are reserved and cannot be
        taken by someone else while sign up still in progress
        User cannot yet log in with their details

    Redirect to page asking to check email
        Option to change email and resend if it was entered incorectly
        Option to cancel sign up (removes user details from database)
        Must be able to return to this point if browser exited/session deleted
        If email link not clicked within time frame (e.g. 30 minutes) sign up is cancelled and user is removed
    
    Code entered correctly (if incorrect, prompt user again)
        User marked as fully signed up and now able to access site with their account


forgotten password:
    Email sent containing url to password reset page (with a unique code in the url)
        Url expires after some time (e.g. 30 minutes)
    User enters new password here (twice for confirmation)
        Password is updated in database
        Return them to the normal login screen to force them knowing username, password and having email for 2fa in case
        email link for reset password is guessed


changing password:
    Require user to know old password and submit along with the new one
    Send alert email that the password has been changed


email changed:
    User must enter password as well as the email they wish to use
        Alert email sent to previous address, but cannot require authentication from that email since the main use case
        For changing email address would be that the user no longer has access to the old one
        This may mean it would be a good idea to prevent username changes, since if the account is compromised an
        attacker could completely change all details to things the user doesn't know, and won't be able to recover (with
        our hypothetical tech support they would contact)
    
    redirect to page asking for email code
        Same as signup, except the email doesn't change over until whole process complete - the previous email is still
        valid up to this point
